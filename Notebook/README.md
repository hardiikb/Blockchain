## Problem

Today, identity is often defined as physical possession of a hardcopy document that can be lost, altered or falsely replicated, whoâ€™s validation often includes long and tedious presentation of yet other hardcopy documents. 

## Idea

Create an individualized secure record of a resident that can be accessed and used for government records.
My proposal includes virtual identification coupled with biometric trigger to create unambiguous and private identification system using blockchain. 


### Why Hyperledger ?

Permissioned blockchain unlike Ethereum.
Participant nodes are only responsible for the channels they belong to.
Relatively, highly scalable and ensures privacy unlike ethereum
